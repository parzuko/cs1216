Instr Mem -> Reg File -> ALU -> Data Mem -> Reg Write Back

Number of stages eventually has diminishing returns because there of inter stage dependencies. The more stages you have, the more you have to wait for the previous stage to finish before you can start the next stage. This is why the number of stages is usually 5 or 6.
Also there is overhead for latches.

5 Stage Pipeline
IM - Instruction Memory
RF - Register File
ALU - Arithmetic Logic Unit
DM - Data Memory
WB - Write Back

RF Should be in second half of cycle and WB should in first half of cycle. This removes dependancy overhead incase.
