Lecture 5: Procedure Calls

Code

Procedures allocated memory = Activation Record
Start and End of it are called $fp and $sp
$a0, $a1, $a2, $a3 are used to pass parameters
$v0, $v1 are used to return values
$ra is used to return to the caller

to call a procedure:
-- jal procedure_name

to return from a procedure:
-- jr $ra

Program Counter is a special register that holds the address of the current instruction to be executed. It tells you where you are in the program. Increments itself by 4.

We must save $ra and other registers using saves are restores.
This usually comprises $s0 - $s7, $ra, $a0 - $a3

Before all instructions, save using sw $reg, offset($sp)
After all instructions, restore using lw $reg, offset($sp)
