Moore's Law -> The number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18 months.

Amdahl's law -> performance improvements through an enhancement is limited by the fraction of time the enhancement comes into play.

Energy = (Power * Time)

90-10 Rule -> 10% of the programme accounts for 90% of the execution time.

Temporal Locality -> Same data will be used again.
Spatial Locality -> Nearby data is likely to be used again.
