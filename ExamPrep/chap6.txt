Large Data

Immediates are capped to 16 Bit Constants

[A         |         B]

lui $t0, A #first 16 bits set
ori $t0, $t0, B #last 16 bits set


jump can only specify 26 bit addresses

Endian-Ness

Memory: 
low-address <- 45 7b 87 7f -> high-address

Little Endian -> x86
highest byte goes into lowest address

Big Endian -> MIPS
highest byte goes into highest address
